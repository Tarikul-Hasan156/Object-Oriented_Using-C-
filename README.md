# ðŸ§¾ Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This repository contains all my lab work and assignments from the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course using **C++**, completed during my undergraduate studies at **BUBT (Bangladesh University of Business and Technology)**.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

The course introduced both fundamental and advanced concepts of OOP using C++. Topics covered include:

- âœ… Classes and Objects  
- âœ… Constructors and Destructors  
- âœ… Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Hierarchical)  
- âœ… Polymorphism (Compile-Time and Run-Time)  
- âœ… Friend Functions  
- âœ… Operator Overloading  
- âœ… File Handling  
- âœ… Templates  

## ðŸ§ª Lab Work Structure

Each lab includes one or more practical problems focused on a specific OOP concept. Each folder typically contains:

- âœ… C++ source code files (`.cpp`)
- ðŸ§  My explanation or approach where relevant


> ðŸ’¡ Each file is named clearly to reflect its content for easy navigation.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** GCC / G++ (Code::Blocks, VS Code, or CLI)  
- **Operating System:** Windows / Linux  

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo Matters

This repository is a showcase of:

- My understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Clean, modular, and readable C++ code
- Academic and hands-on growth in structured programming

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

These programs were developed for educational purposes as part of my university coursework. Others are welcome to reference or learn from them, but direct copying without understanding the concept is discouraged.
